# asteroid

A highly opionated browser ಠ▃ಠ

Asteroid is more than just a browser, its a concept of how we should interact with the web, it has similar ideologies like Arc, however its not there.

This is my first android app, and project using DroidScript, so the code sucks its ugly, remember this code was written by 16 year old me.

Anyway, i don't think ill be maintaining this further, i realized we out of the golden spade era, people arent looking for apps to install anymore.

However ive placed this code here for others looking to learn DroidScript, or build applications using it, this serves as a way to show that indeed DroidScript apps can handle complexity.

Here are some screenshots of my work :
